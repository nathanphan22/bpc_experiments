# BOP DATASET: IPD [1]


## Dataset parameters

* Objects: 10
* Object models: Mesh models
* Modalities: Three IPS cameras and one depth camera (Photoneo) are placed in each scene. 
                Image, depth, angle of linear polarization (AOLP), and degree of linear 
                polarization (DOLP) data are captured by each IPS camera. Image and depth 
                are captured by Photoneo.

## Training PBR images splits

Scenes 000000–000004 contain objects 0, 8, 18, 19, 20.
Scenes 000005–000009 contain objects 1, 4, 10, 11, 14.
